 * no file names should contain '_' (underscore). Use '-' (dash) instead.

 * use underscore_case to name non-const variables and UpperCamelCase for class names;

 * Always put code in namespaces. The closing brace for the namespace should includes as comment the name of the NS it
    closes

  * On the line with the ending bracket of class definitions in headers, add as comment '  // class ClassName'.

 * void methods should return an int instead;
    - return value 0 means operation successfull
    - any other value will denote an error code in some context

 * Constructors and (virtual) destructors of hierarchied classes should be declared in .h file and defined
    in .cpp file. Otherwise you will get "undefined reference to constructor" which is actually defined.

 * Use CAPS_LOCK_SUFFIX to name the different objects in the CMakeLists file, where SUFFIX can be one of:
    - MDL: for internal modules
    - SRCS: for set of source files
    - HDRS: for set of header files

 * Enum names should be all CAPITAL_CASE_NAME with the suffix _ENUM.

 * Default function parameter values are allowed even if not documented ( for now ).
